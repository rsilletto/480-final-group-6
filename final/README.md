Final Project: Enhancing The MAG's Centennial Sculpture Garden Walks with AR

In our project, an interactive and informational experience at the [Memorial Art Gallery](https://mag.rochester.edu/) in downtown Rochester, we hope to increase the general Rochester public’s (and visitors’) engagement with their [Centennial Sculpture Park](https://mag.rochester.edu/collection/centennial-sculpture-park/), by providing visual spectacles alongside much more accessible means for users to reach information about the park, its artists, installations, and history, that is usually hidden away on its website and unlikely to be reached while physically in the space. For each major sculpture and installation, we will provide a 3D object for a user to click on, revealing information and potentially images teaching them about the installation and how it came to be.
